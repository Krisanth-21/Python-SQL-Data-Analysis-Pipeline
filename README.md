# Python-SQL Data Analysis Pipeline

# DESCRIPTION:
    This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis pipeline using Python and SQL. 
    It leverages the Kaggle API to fetch a retail orders dataset, performs data cleaning and transformation with Pandas,
    and loads the processed data into SQL Server for in-depth analysis.
# KEY FEATURES:
# Data Acquisition: 
    Utilizes the Kaggle API to download the required dataset.
# Data Cleaning and Preparation: 
    Employs Pandas to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and perform data transformations.
# Data Loading: 
    Populates SQL Server with the cleaned and prepared data for efficient analysis.
# Data Analysis: Executes SQL queries to address specific business questions, such as:
    Identifying top-selling and revenue-generating products.
    Analyzing regional sales trends.
    Comparing sales performance across different time periods.
    Evaluating profit growth for various product categories.
# PREREQUISITES:
    Python version above 4
    Pandas
